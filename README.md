# Obstory for Obsidian

Obstory keeps screenplay drafting moving inside Obsidian. Connect your OpenAI account, ask for the next beat, or polish dialogue without leaving the note you are writing.

## Quick start
1. In Obsidian, open **Settings → Community plugins** and toggle on community plugins if you have not already.
2. Select **Browse**, search for “Obstory”, then install the plugin and click **Enable**.
3. Still in Settings, open **Obstory** and paste your OpenAI API key.
4. Choose an OpenAI chat model, adjust any other options, and you are ready to write.

## Ghost suggestions
Pause while typing to see inline ghost text. Accept with `Tab`, accept the next chunk with `Alt + →` (Windows/Linux) or `Option + →` (macOS), or dismiss with `Esc`.

## Settings
- **Primary language** – bias responses toward your preferred language.
- **Model & token limits** – pick any OpenAI chat model you can access and set max tokens for completions and ghost hints.
- **Ghost suggestions** – toggle the feature or adjust how long the suggestions can be.
